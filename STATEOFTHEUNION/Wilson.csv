GENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:
When I addressed myself to performing the duty laid upon the President by the Constitution to present to you an annual report on the state of the Union, I found my thought dominated by an immortal sentence of Abraham Lincoln's-""Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith let us dare to do our duty as we understand it"" -a sentence immortal because it embodies in a form of utter simplicity and purity the essential faith of the nation, the faith in which it was conceived, and the faith in which it has grown to glory and power.","Sentiment(polarity=0.07142857142857142, subjectivity=0.4589285714285714)",0.07142857142857142,0.4589285714285714
"With that faith and the birth of a nation founded upon it came the hope into the world that a new order would prevail throughout the affairs of mankind, an order in which reason and right would take precedence over covetousness and force; and I believe that I express the wish and purpose of every thoughtful American when I say that this sentence marks for us in the plainest manner the part we should play alike in the arrangement of our domestic affairs and in our exercise of influence upon the affairs of the world.","Sentiment(polarity=0.1644155844155844, subjectivity=0.31805194805194803)",0.1644155844155844,0.31805194805194803

Democracy is an assertion of the right of the individual to live and to be treated justly as against any attempt on the part of any combination of individuals to make laws which will overburden him or which will destroy his equality among his fellows in the matter of right or privilege; and I think we all realize that the day has come when Democracy is being put upon its final test.,"Sentiment(polarity=0.08463203463203461, subjectivity=0.49523809523809526)",0.08463203463203461,0.4952380952380953
